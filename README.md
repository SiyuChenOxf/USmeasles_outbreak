# School-Level Susceptibility and Measles Outbreaks in Two US Counties
Recent JAMA publications have documented declining county-level measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) [1] and other childhood diseases vaccination coverage [2] and modeled measles reemergence risk [3]. However, county-level surveillance may be insufficient for measles (R0 = 12–18), which requires >95% coverage for local containment. The 2025 measles outbreak in Gaines County, Texas (414 cases) and the ongoing 2025-2026 outbreak in Spartanburg County, South Carolina (847+ cases as of January 30, 2026) represent the largest measles outbreaks in the United States since 2000. Despite similar county-level vaccination coverage (84.0% vs 88.6%), these outbreaks demonstrate strikingly different trajectories. In this letter, we compared school-level vaccination data from the Gains County and Spartanburg County to examine whether school-level vaccination coverage explains their divergent trajectories [5-6].
## Data
Texas: 
1. Kindergarten MMR vaccination coverage, 2019-2024 https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage
2. 7th grade MMR vaccination coverage, 2019-2024 https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage
3. Measles outbreak trajectories in Gaines County was obtained from Johns Hopkins Measles Tracking Dashboard [4] https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker

South Carolina: 
1. MMR vaccination coverage across all grades, 2025-2026 https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-12/45_Day_Report_25-26_20251230.pdf
3. Measles outbreak trajectories in Spartanburg County was obtained from South Carolina Department of Health Dashboard https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/measles-dashboard
