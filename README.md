# School-Level Vaccination Surveillance: Lessons from Two Measles Outbreaks
Recent JAMA publications have documented declining county-level measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) [1] and other childhood diseases vaccination coverage [2] and modeled measles reemergence risk [3] and vaccination strategy [4]. However, county-level surveillance may be insufficient for measles (R0 = 12–18), which requires >95% coverage for local containment. The 2025 measles outbreak in Gaines County, Texas (414 cases) and the ongoing 2025-2026 outbreak in Spartanburg County, South Carolina (847+ cases as of January 30, 2026) represent the largest measles outbreaks in the United States since 2000. Despite similar county-level vaccination coverage (84.0% vs 88.6%), these outbreaks demonstrate strikingly different trajectories. In this letter, we compared school-level vaccination data from the Gains County and Spartanburg County to examine whether school-level vaccination coverage explains their divergent trajectories.
